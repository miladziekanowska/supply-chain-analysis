This repository contains my analysis of Supply Chain data.  
Data provided in this analysis has been borrowed from this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis). This dataset contains data from Fashion and Beauty startup and is a supply chain of Make-up products.

## Why this analysis?
Supply chain analytics are one of the essential elements when making decisions in many fields, such as retail, procurment, logistics and farming. In this process I will be analyzing and interpreting the movement of products and it's customers preferences in order to give a good, data-driven insight at the stong points and weaker spots of supply chain and demand.
